<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> miles beyond the walls of ‘merrie Carlisle,’
and only just across the Border on the Scottish
side, is a lonely old-world little village, whither,
in days not yet remote, frequent couples, in life’s
bright golden time, hurriedly resorted; no less
eager to cross the bridge spanning the river Sark,
which here forms the boundary of the two kingdoms,
than, with blind trust in the future, to
undertake the all-untried responsibilities of forbidden
wedlock. The village itself consists of a
long straight street of cleanly whitewashed houses,
beyond which stretches the solitary tract of Solway
moss, scene of many a Border foray, and of
one miserable ‘rout’ in the days of the Scottish
Jameses; while, towards England, the landscape
is bounded by the ‘skyey heads’ of the Cumberland
mountains, clad in such hues of grayish
green as nature uses to modify her distant tints.
Curious to view a spot so far renowned, albeit
without design of invoking aid from any chance
survivor of the ‘high-priests of Gretna Green,’
we alighted on the platform of its roadside
station on the Glasgow and South-Western Railway
one summer afternoon, and pursuing our
way towards the village in company with a not
uncommunicative policeman, quickly found many
illusions dispelled, by no means least the widespread
legend as to the officiating blacksmith.
Our attention was ere long called to the figure
of a middle-aged, by no means clerical-looking
man, at the time engaged in filling his pipe by
the wayside, with whom we entered into conversation.
Nowise anxious to magnify his apostleship,
our new friend somewhat deprecatingly
acknowledged that the priestly mantle had descended
upon his too unworthy shoulders, and
that, indeed, but a few days prior to our visit,
he had been called on to exercise the weighty
functions of his office.</p>

<p>This man, by trade a mason, spoke, not without
regret, of the good old days when fugitive lovers
crowded to the Border village, the poorer sort
being most often united at the tollhouse just
across the bridge, while the more well-to-do
betook themselves to the hotel, which, though
no longer devoted to uses hymeneal, still stands
at the entrance of the village street. The priestly
office, it was said, had been filled, more or less
worthily, by many, who, claiming no unbroken
descent, had in a somewhat casual sort of way
succeeded to it; and amongst others concerned
in what certainly appeared to have been the
staple trade of the place, the local postman was
indicated as custodian of registers reaching back
into the palmy days of Border marriage, and
containing names no less remarkable for nobility
of birth than for the possession of wealth and
acres.</p>

<p>Left at length to ourselves, we passed onward
up the village street; not a few small inns were
there, the landlady of one of the very least of
which assured us that as many as nine couples
at a time had, in days when business was brisk,
sought the shelter of her tiny roof. A little way
farther on, we did not fail to notice the name
of ‘Lord Erskine’ scratched upon an ancient
and decidedly rickety pane in a window of the
<i>Queen’s Head</i>, where also is exhibited, framed
and glazed of course, his so-called marriage certificate,
in form precisely as in use to-day, thus:
‘<i>Kingdom of <span class="smcap">Scotland</span>, County of <span class="smcap">Dumfries</span>,
Parish of <span class="smcap">Gretna</span>.</i>—These are to certify, to
all whom they may concern, that ——, from the
parish of ——, in the county of ——; and ——,
from the parish of ——, in the county of ——,
being now both here present, and having declared
to me that they are single persons, have now
been married after the manner of the laws of
Scotland. As witness our hands at Gretna Green,
this — day of —— 188-.’ Witnesses (two in
number).</p>

<p>That a marriage like this can still be solemnised
between ‘such as will not get them to
church, and have a good priest that can tell them
what marriage is,’ may come as a surprise to
many who have believed that the glories of
Gretna Green lay all in the past. Not only,
however, had we the assurance of our friend the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">{194}</span>
mason; but a tale of recent matrimonial venture
was imparted, as evidence conclusive that Border
marriage is even now an occurrence by no
means unfrequent. The <i>dramatis personæ</i> in this
real nineteenth-century romance were a young
English lady, who, as a visitor at a neighbouring
resort of pleasure, had satisfied the requisite
condition of three weeks’ residence in Scotland
by one of the parties; and a young officer
in an infantry regiment. Taking the train one
fine morning to Gretna Green, the lady was met
at the station by her intended bridegroom, with
whom she was speedily and indissolubly, according
to local rite, made one for aye. Neither
can any man say that ‘not being well married,
it will be a good excuse for him hereafter to
leave his wife,’ because, provided that two witnesses
be present and the questions put be satisfactorily
replied to, weddings such as these lack
nought of the legal validity and obligation of
those contracted with pealing organ and the
most ceremoniously conducted ecclesiastical display.
The Act of 1856 only makes Scotch
marriages illegal in the case of one or other
of the parties not having resided for three
weeks in the kingdom of Scotland, thereby
putting a stop to many runaway marriages,
especially among servants, who came across in
numbers from Carlisle at the season of annual
hirings.</p>

<p>Not very long since, a faithless swain, weary
prematurely of vows exchanged at Gretna Green,
and doubting somewhat, it may be, of the holiness
of the estate inaugurated by rites so
maimed, betook himself, in the company of
another and, to him, doubtless fairer bride, to
a Roman Catholic priest in a southern Scottish
burgh, who all unwittingly solemnised a marriage
between them, destined to work no small
evil to the fickle bridegroom; for mark how
well the sequel hangs together. The deceiver,
a sadder and perchance wiser man, torn from
the arms of his too credulous bride, a Niobe all
tears, was hauled before the outraged majesty
of law, and compelled to undergo the penalties,
not trivial, awarded to crimes of perjury and
bigamy.</p>

<p>Whatever peculiar popularity as a marriage-resort
may have been enjoyed by Gretna Green
is doubtless due to the convenience and accessibility
of its situation on the Great North Road;
for here is no instance of especial virtue residing
in local fountains, but merely of such virtue—if,
indeed, one may so use the term—as is
participated in by every other spot of ground
within the whole realm of Scotland; nor, indeed,
as a matter of fact, were Coldstream and Lamberton
near Berwick without some measure of
peculiar advantage, which they offered to those
impatient ones who, from the more eastern counties,
were minded to avail themselves of the
proximity of the Scottish Border.</p>

<p>The origin of these marriages has been sought
by some in the wild habits of times far distant,
when lack of clergy in the district was to some
extent supplied by the ministrations of friars
from the adjacent abbeys of Melrose and Jedburgh,
who in the course of their perambulations
performed the rites of baptism and marriage.
The Borderer, nowise forgetful, ere setting forth
on expeditions of rapine and plunder, to tell
his beads right zealously, was yet grossly ignorant
about many things; nor had he access to
any other source of enlightenment than the
‘Book-a-bosoms,’ as the mass-book was called,
from the habit of the wandering ecclesiastics
carrying it in their bosoms. Thus it was that
stout William of Deloraine seemed, to the astonished
eyes of the Goblin Page, so strangely to
resemble one of these friars, when</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Like a book-bosomed priest should ride.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But it may have been that this custom originated
at Gretna Green about 1738, on the suppression
of the infamous Fleet marriages, though,
without doubt, irregular marriage was far from
unknown long prior to this time in the Border
parishes. At all events, acting on his knowledge
that Scotch marriages, where parties accepted
each other as man and wife before witnesses,
were legal, one Scott opened a place at the Rigg,
in the parish of Gretna, and there marriages
were celebrated between runaway couples about
the year 1753. Scott was succeeded by an old
soldier named Gordon, who was wont to officiate
in uniform, wearing a huge cocked-hat, and girt
about the waist with a ponderous sword.</p>

<p>In 1842 were published by Robert Elliott the
<i>Gretna Green Memoirs</i>, wherein we are told how
Elliott—a retired stagecoach driver—became
acquainted with Joseph Paisley, successor of the
veteran Gordon in 1810. Paisley, who had been
a tobacconist, fisherman, nay, even, it is more
than hinted, a smuggler, became known as ‘the
blacksmith,’ from the speed with which he
riveted the bonds of runaway couples. Elliott,
who married Paisley’s daughter, and eventually
succeeded him in his office, continued sole
and only ‘parson’ of Gretna Green for twenty-nine
years, during which period he is said to
have united more than three thousand couples
of all ranks and grades in society, the greatest
number in any one year (1825) having been
one hundred and ninety-eight, and the average
from 1829 to 1835 inclusive upwards of one
hundred and sixty each year. Although tradition
says that Lord Erskine paid as much as
eighty guineas on the occasion of his marriage,
the average fee at Gretna Green is estimated
at fifteen guineas; whence we may at anyrate
infer how much more highly paid was the
Border ‘parson’ than the majority of the more
regular clergy on either side of the Sark.</p>

<p>In a will-case tried some years ago at Liverpool,
the plaintiff, Robert Ker, had been married
on two occasions at Gretna Green—in 1850, and
again in 1853—the first marriage having been
solemnised in a beerhouse at Springfield, near
Gretna; and the second in an alehouse kept
by William Blythe, when Thomas Blythe, in
presence of his wife, performed the ceremony,
which was thus described: ‘I went in and had
some conversation, and asked him [Thomas Blythe]
to do this little job. He said he would, and asked
me if I was willing to take this lady as my wife,
and I said yes. Then he asked her if she was
willing to take me for her husband, and she
said she was; and I got hold of her hand and
put the ring on, and we were declared man
and wife; and that was how we were married.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">{195}</span>
At this trial, a book containing a register of
marriages performed by the Blythes was produced
in evidence.</p>

<p>Thomas Blythe was himself examined in the
Probate Court at Westminster, and stated that
in the May of 1853 he was living at Springfield,
Gretna Green, and was in the agricultural
line, though he did a small stroke of business
in the ‘joining line’ as well. Replying to counsel
as to how he performed the ceremony, he gave
the following account of the marriage service
as by him conducted: ‘I first asked if they were
single. They said they were. I then asked the
man: “Do you take this woman for your wife?”
He said, “Yes.” I then asked the woman:
“Do you take this man for your lawful husband?”
She said, “Yes.” I then said: “Put
on the ring.” The ring was put on. I then
said: “The thing is done; the marriage is complete.”’
A certificate of marriage was written
out and given to the woman.</p>

<p>We doubt not, however, that many of our
readers may learn with surprise that, even now,
marriage—provided that one or other of the
parties have resided three weeks in Scotland—may
be thus speedily and effectually performed
at the erstwhile notorious little village of Gretna
Green, as well as elsewhere north of the Border.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A fortnight</span> after Nora’s arrival in Trinidad,
Mr Tom Dupuy, neatly dressed in all his best,
called over one evening at Orange Grove for the
express purpose of speaking seriously with his
pretty cousin. Mr Tom had been across to see
her more than once already, to be sure, and
had condescended to observe to many of his
men acquaintances, on his return from his call,
that Uncle Theodore’s girl, just come out from
England, was really in her own way a most
elegant and attractive creature. In Mr Tom’s
opinion, she would sit splendidly at the head
of the table at Pimento Valley. ‘A man in
my position in life wants a handsome woman,
you know,’ he said, ‘to do the honours, and
keep up the dignity of the family, and look
after the women-servants, and all that sort of
thing; so Uncle Theodore and I have arranged
beforehand that it would be a very convenient
plan if Nora and I were just to go and make
a match of it.’</p>

<p>With the object of definitely broaching this
preconcerted harmony to his unconscious cousin,
Mr Tom had decked himself in his very smartest
coat and trousers, stuck a <i>gloire de Dijon</i> rose in
his top button-hole, mounted his celebrated gray
Mexican pony ‘Sambo Gal,’ and ridden across
to Orange Grove in the cool of the evening.</p>

<p>Nora was sitting by herself with her cup of
tea in the little boudoir that opened out on to
the terrace garden, with its big bamboos and
yuccas and dracœna trees, when Mr Tom Dupuy
was announced by Rosina as waiting to see
her.</p>

<p>‘Show him in, Rosina,’ Nora said with a
smile; ‘and ask Aunt Clemmy to send me up
another teacup.—Good-evening, Tom. I’m afraid
you’ll find it a little dull here, as it happens,
this evening, for papa’s gone down to Port-of-Spain
on business; and so you’ll have nobody
to talk with you to-night about the prospects
of the year’s sugar-crop.’</p>

<p>Tom Dupuy seated himself on the ottoman
beside her with cousinly liberty. ‘Oh, it don’t
matter a bit, Nora,’ he answered with his own
peculiar gallantry. ‘I don’t mind. In fact, I
came over on purpose this evening, knowing
Uncle Theodore was out, because I’d got something
very particular I wanted to talk over
with you in private.’</p>

<p>‘In-deed,’ Nora answered emphatically. ‘I’m
surprised to hear it. I assure you, Tom, I’m
absolutely ignorant on the subject of cane-culture.’</p>

<p>‘Girls brought up in England mostly are,’ Tom
Dupuy replied with the air of a man who generously
makes a great concession. ‘They don’t
appear to feel much interest in sugar, like other
people. I suppose in England there’s nothing
much grown except corn and cattle.—But that
wasn’t what I came over to talk about to-night,
Nora. I’ve got something on my mind that
Uncle Theodore and I have been thinking over,
and I want to make a proposition to you about
it.’</p>

<p>‘Well, Tom?’</p>

<p>‘Well, Nora, you see, it’s like this. As you
know, Orange Grove is Uncle Theodore’s to leave;
and after his time, he’ll leave it to you, of course;
but Pimento Valley’s entailed on me; and that
being so, Uncle Theodore lets me have it on
lease during his lifetime, so that, of course, whatever
I spend upon it in the way of permanent
improvements is really spent in bettering what’s
practically as good as my own property.’</p>

<p>‘I understand. Quite so.—Have a cup of
tea?’</p>

<p>‘Thank you.—Well, Pimento Valley, you know,
is one of the very best sugar-producing estates
in the whole island. I’ve introduced the patent
Browning regulators for the centrifugal process;
and I’ve imported some of these new Indian
mongooses that everybody’s talking about, to kill
off the cane-rats; and I’ve got some splendid
stock rattoons over from Mauritius; and altogether,
a finer or more creditable irrigated estate
I don’t think you’ll find—though it’s me that
says it—in the island of Trinidad. Why, Nora,
at our last boiling, I assure you the greater part
of the liquor turned out to be seventeen over
proof; while the molasses stood at twenty-nine
specific gravity; giving a yield, you know, of
something like one hogshead decimal four on
the average to the acre of canes under cultivation.’</p>

<p>Nora held up her fan carelessly to smother a
yawn. ‘I daresay it did, Tom,’ she answered
with obvious unconcern; ‘but, you know, I
told you I didn’t understand anything on earth
about sugar; and you said it wasn’t about that
that you wanted to talk to me in private this
evening.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes, Nora; you’re quite right; it isn’t.
It’s about a far deeper and more interesting
subject than sugar that I’m going to speak to
you.’ (Nora mentally guessed it must be rum.)
‘I only mentioned these facts, you see, just
to show you the sort of yield we’re making
now at Pimento Valley. Last year, we did five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">{196}</span>
hundred hogsheads, and two hundred and eighty-four
puncheons. A man who does a return like
that, of course, must naturally be making a very
tidy round little income.’</p>

<p>‘I’m awfully glad to hear it, I’m sure, for
your sake,’ Nora answered unconcernedly.</p>

<p>‘I thought you would be, Nora; I was sure
you would be. Naturally, it’s a matter that
touches us both very closely. You see, as you’re
to inherit Orange Grove, and as I’m to inherit
Pimento Valley, Uncle Theodore and I think
it would be a great pity that the two old
estates—the estates bound up so intimately
with the name and fame of the fighting Dupuys—should
ever be divided or go out of the
family. So we’ve agreed together, Uncle Theodore
and I, that I should—well, that I should
endeavour to unite them by mutual arrangement.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t exactly understand,’ Nora said, as
yet quite unsuspicious of his real meaning.</p>

<p>‘Why, you know, Nora, a man can’t live
upon sugar and rum alone.’</p>

<p>‘Certainly not,’ Nora interrupted; ‘even if
he’s a confirmed drunkard, it would be quite
impossible. He must have something solid occasionally
to eat as well.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, yes,’ Tom said, in a sentimental tone,
endeavouring to rise as far as he was able to
the height of the occasion. ‘And he must
have something more than that too, Nora: he
must have sympathy; he must have affection:
he must have a companion in life; he must
have somebody, you know, to sit at the head
of his table, and to—to—to’——</p>

<p>‘To pour out tea for him,’ Nora suggested
blandly, filling his cup a second time.</p>

<p>Tom reddened a little. It wasn’t exactly the
idea he wanted, and he began to have a faint
undercurrent of suspicion that Nora was quietly
laughing at him in her sleeve. ‘Ah, well, to
pour out tea for him,’ he went on, somewhat
suspiciously; ‘and to share his joys and sorrows,
and his hopes and aspirations’——</p>

<p>‘About the sugar-crop?’ Nora put in once
more, with provoking calmness.</p>

<p>‘Well, Nora, you may smile if you like,’
Tom said warmly; ‘but this is a very serious
subject, I can tell you, for both of us. What
I mean to say is that Uncle Theodore and I
have settled it would be a very good thing
indeed if we two were to get up a match
between us.’</p>

<p>‘A match between you,’ Nora echoed in a
puzzled manner—‘a match between papa and
you, Tom! What at? Billiards? Cricket?
Long jumping?’</p>

<p>Tom fairly lost his temper. ‘Nonsense, Nora,’
he said testily. ‘You know as well what I
mean as I do. Not a match between Uncle
Theodore and me, but a match between you
and me—the heir and heiress of Orange Grove
and Pimento Valley.’</p>

<p>Nora stared at him with irrepressible laughter
twinkling suddenly out of all the corners of her
merry little mouth and puckered eyelids. ‘Between
you and me, Tom,’ she repeated incredulously—‘between
you and me, did you say?
Between you and me now? Why, Tom, do
you really mean this for a sort of an offhand
casual proposal?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, you may laugh if you like,’ Tom Dupuy
replied evasively, at once assuming the defensive,
as boors always do by instinct under
similar circumstances. ‘I know the ways of
you girls that have been brought up at highfalutin’
schools over in England. You think
West Indian gentlemen aren’t good enough for
you, and you go running after cavalry-officer
fellows, or else after some confounded upstart
woolly-headed mulatto or other, who come out
from England. I know the ways of you. But
you may laugh as you like. I see you don’t
mean to listen to me now; but you’ll have
to listen to me in the end; for Uncle Theodore
and I have made up our minds about it,
and what a Dupuy makes up his mind about,
he generally sticks to, and there’s no turning
him. So in the end, I know, Nora, you’ll
have to marry me.’</p>

<p>‘You seem to forget,’ Nora said haughtily,
‘that I too am a Dupuy, as much as you are.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, but you’re only a woman, and that’s
very different. I don’t mind a bit about your
answering me <i>no</i> to-day. It seems I’ve tapped
the puncheon a hit too early; that’s all: leave
the liquor alone, and it’ll mature of itself in
time in its own cellar. Sooner or later, Nora,
you see if you don’t marry me.’</p>

<p>‘But, Tom,’ Nora cried, abashed into seriousness
for a moment by his sudden outburst of
native vulgarity, ‘this is really so unexpected
and so ridiculous. We’re cousins, you know;
I’ve never thought of you at all in any way
except as a cousin. I didn’t mean to be rude to
you; but your proposal and your way of putting
it took me really so much by surprise.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, if that’s all you mean,’ Tom Dupuy
answered, somewhat mollified, ‘I don’t mind
your laughing, no, not tuppence. All I mind
is your saying <i>no</i> so straight outright to me. If
you want time to consider’——</p>

<p>‘Never!’ Nora interrupted quickly in a sharp
voice of unswerving firmness.</p>

<p>‘Never, Nora? Never? Why never?’</p>

<p>‘Because, Tom, I don’t care for you; I can’t
care for you; and I never will care for you. Is
that plain enough?’</p>

<p>Tom stroked his chin and looked at her dubiously,
as a man looks at an impatient horse of
doubtful temper. ‘Well,’ he said, ‘Nora, you’re
a fine one, you are—a very fine one. I know
what this means. I’ve seen it before lots of
times. You want to marry some woolly-headed
brown man. I heard you were awfully thick
with some of those people on board the <i>Severn</i>.
That’s what always comes of sending West Indian
girls to be educated in England. You’ll have
to marry me in the end, though, all the same,
because of the property. But you just mark my
words: if you don’t marry me, as sure as fate,
you’ll finish with marrying a woolly-headed
mulatto!’</p>

<p>Nora rose to her full height with offended
dignity. ‘Tom Dupuy,’ she said angrily, ‘you
insult me! Leave the house, sir, this minute,
or I shall retire to my room. Get back to your
sugar-canes and your centrifugals until you’ve
learned better manners.’</p>

<p>‘Upon my word,’ Tom said aloud, as if to
himself, rising to go, and flicking his boot carelessly
with his riding-whip, ‘I admire her all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">{197}</span>
the more when she’s in a temper. She’s one
of your high-steppers, she is. She’s an uncommon
fine girl, too—hanged if she isn’t—and,
sooner or later, she’ll have to marry me.’</p>

<p>Nora swept out of the boudoir without another
word, and walked with a stately tread into her
own room. But before she got there, the ludicrous
side of the thing had once more overcome
her, and she flung herself on a couch in
uncontrollable fits of childish laughter. ‘Oh,
Aunt Clemmy,’ she cried, ‘bring me my tea in
here, will you? I really think I shall die of
laughing at Mr Tom there!’</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<p>For a few days, the Hawthorns had plenty of
callers—but all gentlemen. Marian did not go
down to receive them. Edward saw them by
himself in the drawing-room, accepting their
excuses with polite incredulity, and dismissing
them as soon as possible by a resolutely quiet
and taciturn demeanour. Such a singularly silent
man as the new judge, everybody said, had
never before been known in the district of
Westmoreland.</p>

<p>One afternoon, however, when the two Hawthorns
were sitting out under the spreading
mango-tree in the back-garden, forgetting their
doubts and hesitations in a quiet chat, Thomas
came out to inform them duly that two gentlemen
and a lady were waiting to see them in
the big bare drawing-room. Marian sighed a
sigh of profound relief. ‘A lady at last,’ she
said hopefully. ‘Perhaps, Edward, they’ve begun
to find out, after all, that they’ve made some
mistake or other. Can—can any wicked person,
I wonder, have been spreading around some
horrid report about me, that’s now discovered to
be a mere falsehood?’</p>

<p>‘It’s incomprehensible,’ Edward answered
moodily. ‘The more I puzzle over it, the less
I understand it. But as a lady has called at
last, of course, darling, you’d better come in at
once and see her.’</p>

<p>They walked together, full of curiosity, into
the drawing-room. The two gentlemen rose
simultaneously as they entered. To Marian’s
surprise, it was Dr Whitaker and his father;
and with them had come—a brown lady.</p>

<p>Marian was unaffectedly glad to see their late
travelling companion; but it was certainly a
shock to her, unprejudiced as she was, that the
very first and only woman who had called upon
her in Trinidad should be a mulatto. However,
she tried to bear her disappointment bravely,
and sat down to do the honours as well as she
was able to her unexpected visitors.</p>

<p>‘My daughtah!’ the elder brown man said
ostentatiously, with an expansive wave of his
greasy left hand towards the mulatto lady—‘Miss
Euphemia Fowell-Buxton Duchess-of-Sutherland
Whitaker.’</p>

<p>Marian acknowledged the introduction with a
slight bow, and bit her lip. She stole a look at
Dr Whitaker, and saw at once upon his face
an unwonted expression of profound dejection
and disappointment.</p>

<p>‘An’ how do you like Trinidad, Mrs Hawtorn?’
Miss Euphemia asked with a society simper;
while Edward began engaging in conversation
with the two men. ‘You find de excessiveness
of de temperature prejudicial to salubrity, after
de delicious equability of de English climate?’</p>

<p>‘Well,’ Marian assented smiling, ‘I certainly
do find it very hot.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, exceedingly,’ Miss Euphemia replied, as
she mopped her forehead violently with a highly
scented lace-edged cambric pocket-handkerchief.
‘De heat is most oppressive, most unendurable.
I could wring out me handkerchief, I assure you,
Mrs Hawtorn, wit de extraordinary profusion of
me perspiration.’</p>

<p>‘But this is summer, you must remember,’
Dr Whitaker put in nervously, endeavouring in
vain to distract attention for the moment from
Miss Euphemia’s conversational peculiarities. ‘In
winter, you know, we shall have quite delightful
English weather on the hills—quite delightful
English weather.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, yes,’ the father went on with a broad
smile. ‘In winter, Mrs Hawtorn, ma’am, you will
be glad to drink a glass of rum-and-milk sometimes,
I tell you, to warm de blood on dese chilly
hilltops.’</p>

<p>The talk went on for a while about such
ordinary casual topics; and then at last Miss
Euphemia happened to remark confidentially to
Marian, that that very day her cousin, Mr
Septimius Whitaker, had been married at eleven
o’clock down at the cathedral.</p>

<p>‘Indeed,’ Marian said, with some polite show
of interest. ‘And did you go to the wedding,
Miss Whitaker?’</p>

<p>Miss Euphemia drew herself up with great
dignity. She was a good-looking, buxom, round-faced,
very negro-featured girl, about as dark in
complexion as her brother the doctor, but much
more decidedly thick-lipped and flat-nosed. ‘O
no,’ she said, with every sign of offended prejudice.
‘We didn’t at all approve of de match me cousin
Septimius was unhappily makin’. De lady, I
regret to say, was a Sambo.’</p>

<p>‘A what?’ Marian inquired curiously.</p>

<p>‘A Sambo, a Sambo gal,’ Miss Euphemia replied
in a shrill crescendo.</p>

<p>‘Oh, indeed,’ Marian assented in a tone which
clearly showed she hadn’t the faintest idea of
Miss Euphemia’s meaning.</p>

<p>‘A Sambo,’ Mr Whitaker the elder said, smiling,
and coming to her rescue—‘a Sambo, Mrs
Hawtorn, is one of de inferior degrees in de
classified scale and hierarchy of colour. De
offspring of an African and a white man is a
mulatto—dat, madam, is my complexion. De
offspring of a mulatto and a white man is a
quadroon—dat is de grade immediately superior.
But de offspring of a mulatto and a negress
is a Sambo—dat is de class just beneat us.
De cause of complaint alleged by de family
against our nephew Septimius is dis—dat bein’
himself a mulatto—de very fust remove from de
pure-blooded white man—he has chosen to ally
himself in marriage wit a Sambo gal—de second
and inferior remove in de same progression. De
family feels dat in dis course Septimius has
toroughly and irremediably disgraced himself.’</p>

<p>‘And for dat reason,’ added Miss Euphemia with
stately coldness, ‘none of de ladies in de brown
society of Trinidad have been present at dis
morning’s ceremony. De gentlemen went, but
de ladies didn’t.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">{198}</span></p>

<p>‘It seems to me,’ Dr Whitaker said, in a pained
and humiliated tone, ‘that we oughtn’t to be
making these absurd distinctions of minute hue
between ourselves, but ought rather to be trying
our best to break down the whole barrier of
time-honoured prejudice by which the coloured
race, as a race, is so surrounded.—Don’t you
agree with me, Mr Hawthorn?’</p>

<p>‘Pho!’ Miss Euphemia exclaimed, with evident
disgust. ‘Just listen to Wilberforce! He
has no proper pride in his family or in his
colour. He would go and shake hands wit any
vulgar, dirty, nigger woman, I believe, as black
as de poker; his ideas are so common!—Wilberforce,
I declare, I’s quite ashamed of you!’</p>

<p>Dr Whitaker played nervously with the knob
of his walking-stick. ‘I feel sure, Euphemia,’
he said at last, ‘these petty discriminations
between shade and shade are the true disgrace
and ruin of our brown people. In despising one
another, or boasting over one another, for our
extra fraction or so of white blood, we are
implicitly admitting in principle the claim of
white people to look down upon all of us impartially
as inferior creatures.—Don’t you think so,
Mr Hawthorn?’</p>

<p>‘I quite agree with you,’ Edward answered
warmly. ‘The principle’s obvious.’</p>

<p>Dr Whitaker looked pleased and flattered.
Edward stole a glance at Marian, and neither
could resist a faint smile at Miss Euphemia’s
prejudices of colour, in spite of their pressing
doubts and preoccupations. And yet, they didn’t
even then begin to perceive the true meaning of
the situation. They had not long to wait, however,
for before the Whitakers rose to take their
departure, Thomas came in with a couple of
cards to announce Mr Theodore Dupuy, and his
nephew, Mr Tom Dupuy of Pimento Valley.</p>

<p>The Whitakers went off shortly, Miss Euphemia
especially in very high spirits, because Mrs
Hawthorn had shaken hands in the most cordial
manner with her, before the face of the two
white men. Edward and Marian would fain
have refused to see the Dupuys, as they hadn’t
thought fit to bring even Nora with them; and
at that last mysterious insult—a dagger to her
heart—the tears came up irresistibly to poor
wearied Marian’s swimming eyelids. But Thomas
had brought the visitors in before the Whitakers
rose to go, and so there was nothing left but
to get through the interview somehow, with what
grace they could manage to muster.</p>

<p>‘We had hoped to see Nora long before this,’
Edward Hawthorn said pointedly to Mr Dupuy—after
a few preliminary polite inanities—half
hoping thus to bring things at last to a positive
crisis. ‘My wife and she were school-girls
together, you know, and we saw so much of one
another on the way out. We have been quite
looking forward to her paying us a visit.’</p>

<p>Mr Dupuy drew himself up very stiffly, and
answered in a tone of the chilliest order: ‘I
don’t know to whom you can be alluding, sir,
when you speak of “Nora;” but if you refer
to my daughter, Miss Dupuy, I regret to say
she is suffering just at present from—ur—a severe
indisposition, which unfortunately prevents her
from paying a call on Mrs Hawthorn.’</p>

<p>Edward coughed an angry little cough, which
Marian saw at once meant a fixed determination
to pursue the matter to the bitter end. ‘Miss
Dupuy herself requested me to call her Nora,’
he said, ‘on our journey over, during which we
naturally became very intimate, as she was put
in charge of my wife at Southampton, by her
aunt in England. If she had not done so, I
should never have dreamt of addressing her, or
speaking of her, by her Christian name. As she
did do so, however, I shall take the liberty of
continuing to call her by that name, until I
receive a request to desist from her own lips.
We have long been expecting a call, I repeat,
Mr Dupuy, from your daughter Nora.’</p>

<p>‘Sir!’ Mr Dupuy exclaimed angrily; the blood
of the fighting Dupuys was boiling up now
savagely within him.</p>

<p>‘We have been expecting her,’ Edward Hawthorn
repeated firmly; ‘and I insist upon knowing
the reason why you have not brought her
with you.’</p>

<p>‘I have already said, sir,’ Mr Dupuy answered,
rising and growing purple in the face, ‘that my
daughter is suffering from a severe indisposition.’</p>

<p>‘And I refuse,’ Edward replied, in his sternest
tone, rising also, ‘to accept that flimsy excuse—in
short, to call it by its proper name, that transparent
falsehood. If you do not tell me the
true reason at once, much as I respect and like
Miss Dupuy, I shall have to ask you, sir, to
leave my house immediately.’</p>

<p>A light seemed to burst suddenly upon the
passionate planter, which altered his face curiously,
by gradual changes, from livid blue to
bright scarlet. The corners of his mouth began
to go up sideways in a solemnly ludicrous fashion:
the crow’s-feet about his eyes first relaxed and
then tightened deeply; his whole big body
seemed to be inwardly shaken by a kind of
suppressed impalpable laughter. ‘Why, Tom,’
he exclaimed, turning with a curious half-comical
look to his wondering nephew, ‘do you know—upon
my word—I really believe—no, it can’t
be possible—but I really believe—they don’t even
now know anything at all about it.’</p>

<p>‘Explain yourself,’ Edward said sternly, placing
himself between Mr Dupuy and the door, as if
on purpose to bar the passage outward.</p>

<p>‘If you really don’t know about it,’ Mr Dupuy
said slowly, with an unusual burst of generosity
for him, ‘why, then, I admit, the insult to Miss
Dupuy is—is—is less deliberately intentional
than I at first sight imagined.—But no, no:
you <i>must</i> know all about it already. You can’t
still remain in ignorance. It’s impossible, quite
impossible.’</p>

<p>‘Explain,’ Edward reiterated inexorably.</p>

<p>‘You compel me?’</p>

<p>‘I compel you.’</p>

<p>‘You’d better not; you won’t like it.’</p>

<p>‘I insist upon it.’</p>

<p>‘Well, really, since you make a point of it—but
there, you’ve been brought up like a gentleman,
Mr Hawthorn, and you’ve married a wife
who, as I learn from my daughter, is well connected,
and has been brought up like a lady;
and I don’t want to hurt your feelings needlessly.
I can understand that under such circumstances’——</p>

<p>‘Explain. Say what you have to say; I can
endure it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">{199}</span></p>

<p>‘Tom!’ Mr Dupuy murmured imploringly,
turning to his nephew. After all, the elder
man was something of a gentleman; he shrank
from speaking out that horrid secret.</p>

<p>‘Well, you see, Mr Hawthorn,’ Tom Dupuy
went on, taking up the parable with a sardonic
smile—for he had no such scruples—‘my uncle
naturally felt that with a man of <i>your colour</i>’—— He
paused significantly.</p>

<p>Edward Hawthorn’s colour at that particular
moment was vivid crimson. The next instant
it was marble white. ‘A man of my colour!’
he exclaimed, drawing back in astonishment, not
unmingled with horror, and flinging up his arms
wildly—‘a man of my colour! For heaven’s
sake, sir, what, in the name of goodness, do you
mean by a man of my colour?’</p>

<p>‘Why, of course,’ Tom Dupuy replied maliciously
and coolly, ‘seeing that you’re a brown
man yourself, and that your father and mother
were brown people before you, naturally, my
uncle’——</p>

<p>Marian burst forth into a little cry of intense
excitement. It wasn’t horror; it wasn’t anger;
it wasn’t disappointment: it was simply relief
from the long agony of that endless, horrible
suspense.</p>

<p>‘We can bear it all, Edward,’ she cried aloud
cheerfully, almost joyously—‘we can bear it all!
My darling, my darling, it is nothing, nothing,
nothing!’</p>

<p>And regardless of the two men, who stood
there still, cynical and silent, watching the effect
of their unexpected thunderbolt, the poor young
wife flung her arms wildly around her newly
wedded husband, and smothered him in a perfect
torrent of passionate kisses.</p>

<p>But as for Edward, he stood there still, as
white, as cold, and as motionless as a statue.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CANAL_NAVIGATIONS">CANAL NAVIGATIONS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Until</span> the middle of the last century, our forefathers
thought far more of foreign enterprise
than of the internal communications of their own
island. An Englishman of the time of Elizabeth
might be acquainted with all the intricacies of
the Arctic Ocean or of the West Indies; but it by
no means followed that he was able to sketch a
map of his own country. The sea was the great
highway of trade and fame, and the commercial
towns were all seaports.</p>

<p>Previous to the accession of George III., the
communications throughout England were of the
most wretched kind, the great highways being
simply the worn-out tracks of the old Roman
roads. The manufactures of our country, struggling
into notice, were greatly hampered by this
lack of communication, few facilities for carriage
existing, and distant markets being beyond
reach. The little carrying-trade was necessarily
of the slowest and most expensive kind, and
goods were conveyed to the nearest port or
navigable river, generally by long strings of
packhorses, less frequently by the slow clumsy
stage-wagon. Packhorses conveyed from the
Severn the clay used in the Potteries, bringing
back in return coarse earthenware for
export. The cloth-manufacturer of Yorkshire
saddled his horse with his wares and travelled
from fair to fair as his own salesman; and the
little cotton used in the Manchester looms was
transported from Liverpool in the same primitive
fashion.</p>

<p>This was the state of the communications in
England in 1757, when the Duke of Bridgewater,
having been crossed in love by one of the
beautiful Miss Gunnings, turned his attention
to the more prosaic employment of canal construction.
His idea was to construct a waterway,
or ‘navigation,’ from his coal-pits to Manchester,
a distance of ten miles. Short as this distance
appears in our time, it offered so great a barrier
in those days, that the supply of fuel was always
limited and uncertain. The duke, who was
desirous of engaging an engineer to put his idea
into practical form, was advised to employ the
famous millwright Brindley, who had already
made himself a name in the district for his
clever contrivances in the pottery-works and
the silk-factories. Like many others who have
risen to fame, Brindley was a self-made man.
To his natural-born genius, there were united
two characteristics which are necessary to all
such pioneers—great perseverance, and a confidence
in his own judgment which overbore all
the adverse criticism of the multitude. His
diary, which is extant, shows his school education
to have been of the scantiest; the words, spelt in
the broad Staffordshire dialect, and the painfully
crabbed writing, excite alternately our amusement
and our respect; whilst it shows throughout
the dogged determination of the individual
to overcome difficulty.</p>

<p>Brindley was no sooner installed as engineer
of the works than he completely altered the
duke’s plan. To construct the proposed canal—or
‘novogation,’ as Brindley has it—it was necessary
to cross the river Irwell, and it was here
that he first showed his marvellous courage and
skill. The duke’s plan had been to drop the
canal by a series of locks to the level of the
river, and to raise it again on the farther side
by the same means. But Brindley, who foresaw
that locks would always prove a great hindrance
to traffic, decided that the canal should not
change its level, but should cross the river on
a stone aqueduct. Nothing of the kind had ever
before been attempted in this country, and, to
ordinary minds, the idea of boats, laden with
coals, sailing, as it were in mid-air, seemed
preposterous. It must be allowed, to the everlasting
credit of the duke, that, although somewhat
uncertain in his own mind as to the result of
the scheme, he nevertheless allowed Brindley to
proceed. In spite of general ridicule, the works
were commenced, the aqueduct was built; and
derision was turned into amazement when the
canal-boats passed over and the structure showed
no sign of collapse. The packhorses were dispensed
with, and the price of coal in Manchester
fell to one-half. The success, both to the projector
and the community, was so complete, that
the duke at once sought further powers to extend
the canal westward, and thus to open communication
with the port of Liverpool. After much
opposition from landowners and others, Brindley
commenced this extension; but although no
great engineering difficulties were encountered,
the expenditure for some years had been so
heavy that the want of money threatened to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">{200}</span>
offer a serious obstacle to the completion of the
scheme. The duke’s credit became so low that
the greatest task of the week was the collecting
of a sufficient amount to pay the wages of the
labourers on the works; and it was only by
much scheming and economy that the works
were at length completed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Staffordshire Potteries had
begun to clamour for a waterway, and Brindley
had undertaken the survey of a canal which
was to connect them with the Trent and Mersey.
Wedgwood, the great potter, gave all his influence
to a scheme for uniting his factories with the
sea, and even removed his works to a site on
the proposed canal, known henceforth by the
ancient name of Etruria. The great undertaking
in the construction of this canal was the tunnel,
a mile and a half in length, under that part of
the Pennine chain which separates Staffordshire
from Cheshire. This tunnel was to constitute the
highest point or ‘summit-level’ of the canal; and
the supply of water was to be obtained from a
system of reservoirs situated at a still higher
elevation and fed by the surrounding hills. But
tunnelling was a new experiment in engineering;
many unforeseen difficulties arose to hinder the
work, and it was only after eleven years of heavy
anxiety and stubborn perseverance that this last
link in the communication was completed. The
carriage of a ton of goods from Liverpool to
Etruria, which had cost under the old system
fifty shillings, was reduced to one-fourth. This
tunnel, the pioneer of many miles of tunnelling
since constructed, still exists. It is simply a
long culvert, just large enough to allow of the
passage of a single barge. There is no accommodation
for hauling the traffic through, and
the barges are consequently propelled from end
to end by the exertions of the boatmen alone.
Fifty years after its construction, the traffic on
the canal had increased to such an extent that
the mouths of the tunnel were perpetually
blocked by a crowd of boats waiting to pass
through, and the fights and quarrels among the
boatmen for first place were a disgrace to the
Canal Company. After much pressure, the authorities
called in the Scotch engineer Telford, and
to him was intrusted the construction of a
second tunnel. The want of suitable machinery,
of skilled labour and of money, were obstacles
comparatively unknown to Telford, and the new
tunnel, large enough to allow of a towing-path,
was constructed in three years. The two works,
side by side, represent fifty years’ progress in
the science of engineering.</p>

<p>But to return to Brindley and his triumphs.
In North Warwickshire, a colony of iron-workers
had sprung up in the midst of a plain, worn
into narrow ‘hollow-ways’ by the tread of the
ubiquitous packhorse. The few letters sent to
this large village of blacksmiths were addressed
‘Birmingham, near Coleshill,’ this latter place
being the nearest point on the high road.
Through this district, Brindley succeeded in
cutting a canal from the Trent to the Severn;
and thus Birmingham, the Potteries, and Manchester
were each connected with the Irish and
North Seas.</p>

<p>Brindley’s last great work was the projection
of a canal from Leeds to Liverpool; but owing
partly to the difficulties of the country passed
through, and partly to the scarcity of labourers
through the continental wars, the canal was not
completed throughout until 1816, long after
Brindley’s death. The summit of this canal is
in the wild and stony district of Pendle Forest,
where are situated the great reservoirs—one
being over a hundred acres in extent—which
feed the higher levels of the canal with water.
These reservoirs are maintained in repair and
efficiency at the present day by the owners
of the numerous stone quarries of the district,
to whom the canal offers great facilities for
transit.</p>

<p>Under Rennie and Telford, canal construction
was continued, and old methods were improved
upon. The Barton aqueduct of Brindley sank
into insignificance before the works of these
later engineers, whose canals, instead of winding
round the hillsides to avoid cuttings, were led
through hills and over valleys regardless of
obstacles. Besides the completion of English
canals, we owe to these two men the construction
of the canal from the Forth to the Clyde
and the Caledonian Canal, in Scotland; and the
two parallel canals in Ireland which connect
Dublin with the Atlantic. Thus, in half a
century was the country covered with a network
of waterways, giving an impulse to manufactures
which had hitherto been shut out from foreign
markets.</p>

<p>About the end of last century, a great
impulse was given to the traffic on the canals
by a Mr Baxendale, the agent of Pickford, the
well-known carrier. By his efforts, a thorough
system of canal communication was established
and maintained, and greater punctuality was
observed in the arrival and departure of the
boats. Express or fly boats also came into use
for the more important merchandise and for
passenger traffic. On the Bridgewater Canal,
they plied with passengers between Manchester
and Liverpool; and in the neighbourhood of the
larger towns they conveyed the market-women
home to the surrounding villages. In 1798,
many of the troops for the Irish campaign were
conveyed by canal from London to Liverpool.
When the railway systems were projected, some
of their greatest opponents were the canal Companies,
who fancied they saw in the new mode
of transit, utter ruin to their own traffic. It
was said that the canals would soon become
useless and overgrown with weeds, and it was
even proposed to buy up the canal Companies,
fill in the water-channels, and lay down the line
of rails in their stead. But in spite of all these
dark forebodings, and notwithstanding the utility
of the new method as compared with the old,
the canals still maintain their ground. Their
traffic since the advent of the railways has
steadily increased; canal shares are usually considered
safe stock, and therefore seldom change
hands. Both systems of communication have
their advantages; and whilst the locomotive is
the great economiser of time, there are many
articles of commerce, in the shape of building
materials and fragile goods, in the carrying
of which the canals are more suitable. They
remain at the present day a lasting and still
useful monument to the English enterprise and
perseverance of the last century.</p>

<p>To turn to the present century: M. de Lesseps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">{201}</span>
has been so successful with the Suez Canal, and
promises to be with the Panama one, that it is
no wonder that he should have many followers;
and it is to be noted that the canals proposed
now are all on the large scale—canals for ships
of large size. They are mostly through narrow
necks of land, although one of them is to connect
an inland town, Manchester, about thirty miles
from salt water, directly with the sea. The
Isthmus of Corinth is the site of another; and
still another is to run into the great Sahara of
Africa and convert it into a great salt-water
lake. How long this lake would take to fill
up with solid salt is a nice question, which we
have not sufficient means of determining, as
the other ‘salt lakes’ of the world are all supplied
with fresh water, and have only as yet
attained to a more or less briny state.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> people who have heard of a travelling
theatre may find perhaps the following peep
behind the scenes somewhat interesting.</p>

<p>On a cold, bleak day towards the end of
October 1885, I received the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Respected Lady</span>—I is an actress, and has a
travelling theatre. We came to this village two
days ago; but the times is bad, and business so
slack, I has had to sell most all the theatrical

left us we can wear. Respected lady, I writes
to ask you to have the harte to help me and
my company. Any evening dresses, especial

artificial flowers, will be thankful received
by one who art and health is alike forsakin.
Respected lady, I has a large family to provide
for, and any old stockings and shoes I pray you
to bestow, lady. My daughter is waiting for
an answer. We has a benefit for her to-night.
Any clothes, lady, looks well on the stage.

respectful to command,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Madoline Emerson</span>,<br />
or <span class="smcap">Mary Flanagan</span>.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>I sent for the bearer of the letter, who had,
as intimated, waited for my reply. A little girl
of about eight years old appeared, and bowed
to me very gravely. She was thinly and poorly
clad, and looked miserably cold and wretched.
Her little feet were without stockings, and red
from exposure; they peeped through her broken
shoes.</p>

<p>When I asked her would she like some food
while she waited, her poor pinched little face
brightened as she eagerly said: ‘Yes, lady, if
you please. I have had no breakfast, and I am
so hungry.’ So, while she partook of the meal
she so much needed, I collected what clothes I
could, and gave them to her, promising to have
some more on the morrow, when I desired her
to call again. She did so, bringing with her a
letter full of expressions of gratitude from her
mother for the help I had given. It was on
this occasion I heard from little Mary the
following history of a travelling theatre.</p>

<p>‘We came to this village two days ago. Our
theatre is erected in the street, and we call
ourselves the Emerson Company. That’s my
mother’s name; and it sounds grander-like than
my father’s, which is Flanagan. There are six
of us alive; but my eldest sister is married these
two years, and has a theatre of her own. We
mostly marry into the profession, for we find it
more useful,’ she added. ‘My big sister at home
is fourteen, and we buried two. Next to her,
then I come, and I am eight; and my only
brother, who comes next to me, is six. No more
of us act, because Maggie must mind the baby
while mother is acting. My sister dances and
sings beautifully; and as for an Irish jig, you
never saw the like of her, she’s that good. But
she gets frightfully tired, for she has heart
disease; and the doctor says as how she may
die any minute. I can sing too,’ she continued
proudly; ‘and I could dance on the “tight wire”
too; but I fell off it two years ago, because
I forgot to rub my feet in a white powder we
have to use before going on; and since then,
I am afraid. But my little brother isn’t, and
he can turn a summerset on the wire and
juggle grand. He can throw the knives as
high as that’—indicating with her hands a distance
of three or four feet—‘and can bring the
sharp points of the blades on to the palms of
his hand without so much as giving them a
scratch.’</p>

<p>‘How can he do that, if the knives are so
sharp?’</p>

<p>‘Well, you see, lady, father has a big jar of
stuff like brown oil—I don’t know its real name—and
my brother rubs his hands all over with
some of it—very little does; then the knives
cannot cut him. It will only come off again by
washing his hands in mostly boiling water.’</p>

<p>‘How many are there in your company?’</p>

<p>‘We have only three at present,’ she replied,
‘besides the family. When we want more, my
married sister lends us one or two out of her
troupe; but of course we pay them. Those we
have now act very fair: one gets five shillings
a night; and the other two get three shillings
and half a crown. If we have a good take at
the door, father will give them an extra shilling
apiece all round; but some nights they get all
we make, and we get none. We only took one
pound between these two nights. Business is
slack; but maybe we’ll make more soon, when
the people in the country hear of us; for we are
a most respectable company,’ she added proudly.
‘In the last village we were in, we “took” a
lot because we had the wonderful speaking pony
“Jack.” But another company as had a travelling
theatre too, came while we were there; and
as they were poorer than we were, father, who
is real good to any one in the profession, lent
them the pony.’</p>

<p>‘And what could this wonderful pony do?’</p>

<p>‘He could most speak, lady, he was that clever.
At Pound’s Place—that’s where we were afore
we came here—we lodged with a grocer in the
village. He had a little girl as used to steal
sweets out of the bottle from behind the counter
in the shop; and the pony found it out, and told
on her.’</p>

<p>‘How did he do that? Tell me some of this
clever animal’s tricks.’</p>

<p>‘Well, lady, you see, this night father and
Jack came on the platform as usual. First,
father says: “Now, Jack, who is the biggest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">{202}</span>
rogue in the theatre?” The pony walked round
and looked at every one, and then came back
and stood before father and nodded his head
twice, which meant, “<i>You</i> are.” But that’s only
a part of the play, lady; father isn’t really a
rogue—he’s real good. Then father says again:
“I wonder, Jack, could you discover who likes
a good pinch of snuff?” Jack looked about,
and walked a few steps and then stopped before
the old woman who sold apples round the corner.
’Twas quite true,’ continued the child, ‘for she
used to buy it where we lodged.—After this,
father said: “Now, Jack, as you are so clever,
tell the company which of all the little girls
present likes sweets, and is in the habit of stealing
them?”—and if Jack didn’t find out Mollie—that’s
the little girl as I told you of, lady—and
he nodded and nodded his head ever so often,
to show he was quite sure it was Mollie! She
was very angry, and began to cry, and told Jack
as how she didn’t steal them. But he knew it
was a lie,’ added Mary, ‘for he would not go
away, though father called him. And Mollie she
was that mad, she would never again come inside
the theatre, she said, because the pony <i>told</i> lies
of her before every one!</p>

<p>‘We have different plays each night, and have
beautiful “cuts.” Some nights, when the reserved
seats are mostly empty, we have only singing and
dancing. My sister does a lot of steps then;
and when she comes off the stage she is well-nigh
dead, she is so hot and tired. Mother is
tired every day; for she coughs nearly all night.
We are mostly all tired,’ the child continued,
‘for ’tis twelve o’clock, and often one, before we
get to bed any night. Then there is a rehearsal
every day at twelve o’clock. Mother never gets
up till ’tis time to go to it.—Our tent was partly
blown down last night, lady, for it blew very
hard, and it was much damaged. Every strip
of canvas costs six shillings, and it takes a great
many to make a tent. Mother and the company
are mending it now, while I am here.’</p>

<p>‘How long will you remain in our village?’</p>

<p>‘Maybe a week longer, or maybe two,’ answered
the child; ‘it all depends on the “take” we
have. We were six weeks in Pound’s Place;
but we’ve only made enough these two nights
here to pay the company, and had nothing
for ourselves. We are often hungry, Jim and
me.’</p>

<p>‘Do you like being an actress, and wearing
all those bright dresses, and singing for people
who applaud and praise you?’</p>

<p>‘O no, lady; I hate the life,’ she replied; ‘and
the audience are cross often, if they don’t like
the piece and what we do; and then I get
frightened. Then father sings a comic song, and
they all mostly like that.’</p>

<p>‘How do you manage to take the tent, its
fittings, and your wardrobe about from place to
place?’</p>

<p>‘We have a big wagon as holds everything,
and the horse and the donkey they draw it.
Then father hires a car for us, and another for
the company, and we travel from village to
village that way. We go to the towns in winter.
Our theatre is well known; and in some places
we make six pounds, and maybe seven or eight,
in one night. Other times we might only take—as
we’ve done here—ten shillings. We never
go in debt,’ she added. ‘Mother sells our wardrobe
when we are very poor, and then she asks
kind ladies to help us by giving us their old
clothes. Anything does for the stage so long
as it’s bright. Once mother got a dress from
a lady all over silver stars, and she wore it when
she is the Queen. I doesn’t mean she is a real
queen, but one in the play. But that’s worn
out now,’ she added sadly.</p>

<p>‘I must be going now,’ Mary said, getting up;
‘and I’m very thankful entirely, lady. Maybe
you would send the servants to-morrow night
to the theatre, for Jim is having his benefit.
We don’t have any real ladies come, or I’d be
real glad to see you,’ she concluded ingenuously.</p>

<p>Accordingly, I sent the servants; and from
them I heard that the theatre was the most
wretched place imaginable. A small tent, in
many places broken and saturated with rain,
which had been falling heavily, was pitched in
the principal street in the village. A few forms
served as reserved seats; whilst those who could
not afford this luxury, stood in groups behind.
The stage was raised some three or four feet
from the ground by means of some barrels, on
which long planks of wood were arranged in
rows to form a platform. A few candles placed
along the edge of it served for footlights; whilst
large gaudy ‘cuts,’ representing some specially
attractive character in the several plays acted,
formed the scenery, as Mary had stated; and
on the occasion in question, when singing and
dancing were the only entertainments provided,
the audience were asked if they wished to come
upon the stage and dance an Irish jig or horn-pipe.
One man accepted the invitation, and
danced both so well and with such a will, amusing
the people so effectually, that fully half an
hour’s respite was enjoyed by the tired, weary
company of the travelling theatre.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INDIAN_SERVANTS">INDIAN SERVANTS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A somewhat</span> widespread opinion prevails in this
country that our Anglo-Indian friends, with their
handsome rupee-reckoned salaries, are in the
habit of living more than comfortably, if not
luxuriously, in the far East. But, in reality,
whatever may have been the case formerly, in
what were called ‘the good old times,’ this is
not so nowadays; and we should remember that
what in England may justly be considered to
be a luxury, in a tropical climate like India
often becomes a necessity. Our countrymen
now—unlike their predecessors, who lived like
princes, spent their money freely, and made
India their home—wisely adopt the opposite
course, and look forward to the time when
they may retire on a pension, and pass the
remainder of their days in old England.</p>

<p>Perhaps the chief cause which has given rise
to the erroneous impression above referred to
is the number of native servants which the
young Anglo-Indian usually entertains on first
taking up his appointment in the Civil Service,
the military profession, or other line of business,
as the case may be. His mother and
sisters are astonished to learn by the first
letter received from Jack or Harry—fresh from
school, and perhaps hardly out of his teens—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">{203}</span>
already he has enlisted into his service
no fewer than seven or eight attendants; and
not comprehending the rights of the case,
are apt to moralise on youthful extravagance.
This, however, is a mistake on their part,
which we will endeavour to explain, at the
same time offering a few remarks, for the benefit
of our countrymen daily leaving our shores for
India, on native servants in general, their duties,
peculiarities, and the best way of treating them
to meet with success. But before taking them
individually, it is with regret we feel compelled
to allude to a practice not unfrequently indulged
in by the young and thoughtless, of constantly
using native terms of abuse to their attendants
for the most trivial faults. This is a habit
much to be deprecated. The natives of India
are extraordinary judges of character, and quickly
lose all respect for a master who demeans himself
in this manner; and no native servant of any
worth will permit himself to be cuffed and
knocked about, and, rather than submit to such
treatment, will give up his place immediately.
The submissive air and humble gait of the natives
of India should alone be sufficient to disarm a
European, and prevent him from ever lifting
his hand against one of them, even when provoked
to the uttermost by some gross act of
carelessness or stupidity. A little patience and
kindness, coupled with tact and firmness, will
generally produce the desired effect, and is
much to be preferred to harshness and constant
scolding.</p>

<p>The young Anglo-Indian, on reaching his
destination at, we will suppose, some up-country
station in the North-western Provinces of Bengal
or the Punjab, will, generally speaking, require
the following servants: a <i>bearer</i> or personal
attendant; <i>khitmutghar</i> or table attendant; <i>bheestie</i>
or water-carrier; <i>dhobie</i> or washerman; <i>mehter</i> or
sweeper; <i>syce</i> or groom; and a grass-cutter to
provide fodder for his pony; and throughout
the hot-weather months, two additional <i>coolies</i>
will be necessary to keep the punkah moving
throughout the exhausting nights of the
tropics.</p>

<p>On first landing from the steamer at the end
of the voyage, the young Englishman is sure to
be met by numerous applicants for service. The
door of his hotel will be thronged by eager
candidates for situations; but unless under exceptional
circumstances, such as a fellow-countryman
travelling homewards, and anxious to obtain a
place for a really good servant, he will act
wisely to defer making a selection until he has
reached his journey’s end, when, probably, he
will have more time to look around and make
his selection.</p>

<p>The first and most important servant to procure
is a <i>bearer</i>, and it is by no means an easy
post to fill up satisfactorily. He should be a
Hindu of not too high a caste; nor, on the
other hand, of the opposite extreme, a very low
caste. The latter is almost certain to prove a
failure. There is much to be learned from the
personal appearance and style of dress of native
servants. Certificates to character should be
carefully examined and received with caution;
for not unfrequently these documents are forgeries,
or borrowed for the occasion; sometimes
copies from some genuine certificate supplied to
another individual. The applicant for a place
should also be questioned on the why and the
wherefore of his quitting his last situation. As
to caste, perhaps the <i>kahar</i> is the best for a
<i>bearer</i>. Taken generally, the <i>kahars</i> are an industrious,
quiet race of beings. One of their chief
occupations is carrying palanquins; but the opening
of railways throughout India has in a great
measure done away with this mode of travelling.
It may be mentioned that the title <i>kahar</i> many
years ago was also the distinctive appellation of
a Hindu slave.</p>

<p>As head-servant of the house, the <i>bearer</i> should
always be well dressed, more especially so as
one of his chief duties is to receive visitors
at the door. He should never appear without
wearing a turban, nor ever enter the
house with shoes on his feet. These two
latter remarks apply to every class of servant.
Nor should a plea of forgetfulness for neglect
of the same be ever accepted. The <i>bearer</i> is
responsible for his master’s clothes; he has
charge of the keys. He should be the first astir
in the morning, and call the ‘sahib’ at the
proper hour to dress for parade, the early walk,
or ride. He dusts and arranges the different
rooms while his master is out; and on the
latter’s return has the bath in readiness. With
the exception of an hour or two about mid-day,
when the <i>bearer</i> disappears for his dinner,
he remains in the veranda or within call. He
keeps account of small household expenditures,
again attends his lord on the latter retiring to
rest, when the <i>bearer</i> makes his final salaam or
obeisance, and takes his departure.</p>

<p>The next in importance among Indian domestic
servants is the <i>khitmutghar</i> or table-attendant.
It need hardly be mentioned that
he is invariably of the Mohammedan religion;
and great care is necessary in choosing this particular
servant, for among their ranks are many
low, dissipated characters. A single glance at
one of these latter will generally suffice to make
one aware of the fact. Old graybeards, though
of course less active than younger followers of
the Prophet, yet often prove to be better servants
in the long-run. When questioned, these gentry
almost invariably deny all knowledge of the
English language; but, generally speaking, the
Bengal <i>khitmutghar</i>, as he stands with folded arms
and imperturbable countenance at the dinner-table,
readily follows and fully comprehends the
topics of conversation carried on by his English
masters.</p>

<p>The duties of the <i>khitmutghar</i> commence at
daylight, when he puts in an appearance bearing
the morning cup of tea. Unless otherwise
ordered, he is only expected to be present, properly
dressed, at each meal. One of his most
important duties is to be able to cook fairly
well when called upon to do so, more especially
when his master may move into camp either
on the march or on a shooting expedition. Then
he is expected to show his powers in the culinary
art; and, generally speaking, Mohammedan
cooks acquit themselves admirably in this respect.
They are especially clever at making omelettes,
soufflets, and such-like. It may be here mentioned,
however, by way of warning to the
uninitiated in such matters, that the native
method of preparing a meal is not always too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">{204}</span>
nice to our ideas, so that it is well to avoid
visiting the cooking-tent immediately before
dinner, or not improbably you will there see
something or other going on not calculated to
give one an appetite.</p>

<p>Next in our list comes the <i>bheestie</i> or water-carrier,
also of the Mohammedan religion; but
altogether a less troublesome mortal to deal
with. Generally speaking, the Bengal <i>bheestie</i> is
a good, willing, hard-working servant, seldom
giving trouble or requiring reproof. His chief
duties are to supply the house and stables with
fresh water from the best well in the neighbourhood.
It is the special duty of the <i>bheestie</i> to
keep the <i>chatties</i> or earthen jars of the bathroom
filled with water. Where a garden is kept
up—and in hot climates there is nothing so
refreshing to the eye as a few flowers and bright-green
shrubs around the house—it is the duty
of the <i>bheestie</i> to assist the native gardener in
watering the plants. He also, morning and
evening, sprinkles with water the flooring of the
verandas, footpaths, and dusty roads in the
vicinity of his master’s abode. This has the
effect of laying the dust and cooling the air—no
slight boon to exhausted Europeans during the
terrible months of April and May, just before the
first rainfall.</p>

<p>The <i>dhobie</i> or washerman is another important
individual in the Anglo-Indian establishment.
The great majority of <i>dhobies</i> are Hindus; but
in Eastern Bengal, Mohammedan <i>dhobies</i> are often
to be met with. Though given to assuming airs
and importance, the <i>dhobie</i> is of low caste,
generally speaking; a mild inoffensive being,
plying his trade industriously, and giving little
trouble to his master. There is a proverbial
saying that obtains among the Hindus which
pronounces a <i>dhobie</i> as untrustworthy; but in
reality he is no worse than his brethren in this
respect. The <i>dhobie</i> is one of the first to bestir
himself in the early morning, and accompanied
by a small <i>bail</i> or bullock, carrying his bundle
of clothes, he may be seen making his way in
the direction of some tank or distant pool on
the river-bank. On reaching the scene of operations,
he strips himself of superfluous clothing,
girds up his loins, and proceeds to business.
Soon the air resounds with the heavy thwacks
of some article of raiment, which, twisted into
a small compass, the <i>dhobie</i> again and again
whirls round his head, and brings down upon
a flat piece of wood or stone placed on the
margin of the water. Each blow is accompanied
by a grunt from the operator, as if to give an
additional impetus to the stroke. This somewhat
rough treatment is liable to wear out
fine linen all too soon, and to make buttons
fly; but considering that the <i>dhobie</i> has no mangle
to assist him, nor any of the ordinary appliances
of a laundry, and, generally speaking, only
a small smoky hovel—probably filled to overflowing
with his wife and numerous children—wherein
to complete his work, it is astonishing
how well he acquits himself of his task; the
well-starched, snow-white shirt-fronts bearing witness
to his skill and painstaking. Unless articles
of clothing are plainly marked, the <i>dhobie</i> has
a tiresome habit of sewing coloured pieces of
cotton into the corners of every shirt and handkerchief,
to distinguish them from others, which
practice has anything but a beautifying effect.
The <i>dhobie</i> considers himself so far independent
that he need only appear at stated times, to receive
or make over his master’s clothes from the hands
of the <i>bearer</i>. He will never take service as an
indoor servant in the house of a European.</p>

<p>The duties of the <i>mehter</i>, sweeper or ‘knight
of the broom,’ are so commonplace as to require
only a brief notice. He is always of low caste;
and though often addressed as ‘jemadar’ by
the other servants, he is always looked down
upon, more especially for his habit of eating
or drinking anything left from the table of
his master. It is his special duty to take
charge of and feed his master’s dogs. He supplies
them with food at a fixed rate, takes them
in the early morning for a bathe in the nearest
tank, and towards sunset, produces for inspection,
in separate iron dishes, the food which he
has provided for each one of his charges.</p>

<p>It is amusing to observe how well-bred English
dogs despise and turn up their noses at their
native attendant, permitting the latter to lead
them about and wash them when necessary without
a growl of disapproval, but at the same
time clearly showing by their outward bearing
that no familiarities will be permitted.</p>

<p>Next we come to the <i>syce</i> or native groom;
and in a stable where a valuable Arab horse
has to be cared for, he is a most important
personage. A really good, trustworthy <i>syce</i> is
nowadays seldom to be met with. There are
Mohammedan <i>syces</i> throughout Northern India;
but the great majority are Hindus of low caste.
The duties of the <i>syce</i> are, to groom and feed
the horse he is put in charge of—a separate
<i>syce</i> is necessary for each one of the horses
comprising a stable—to be ready to accompany
his master to the parade-ground, the band-stand,
or for wherever he may be bound; and to keep
the latter in sight and follow him any distance,
no matter at what pace the sahib may choose
to ride. It is astonishing what powers of endurance
these native grooms display in this respect;
for however far the distance or quick the gallop,
he is seldom left far behind, and nearly always
makes his appearance soon after his master draws
rein.</p>

<p>A Bengal <i>syce</i> worthy of the name can hardly
in any country in the world be surpassed at
his work. He is a most excellent groom; and
by means of hand-rubbing—which he often
practises for hours together—he brings out the
muscles and sinews of a horse till they are as
tough and hard as iron. It is a good custom
to inspect daily the allowance of corn or grain
provided by the <i>syce</i> for his charge, as not
unfrequently dishonest grooms steal a portion
of it and grind it for their own food.</p>

<p>The ‘grass-cutter,’ the last in our list, is a
humble individual, who, as his title tells us, supplies
grass for the horse to which he is attached.
Hay is seldom seen in India; but horses thrive
well on a particular kind of soft green grass,
which the grass-cutter cuts, or rather digs up
with a small iron instrument called a <i>koorpah</i>. It
is well, every now and again, to examine the
quality and quantity of the grass supplied for
each horse, or else lazy individuals will likely
enough bring in coarse hard stuff quite unfit
for the purpose. In large stations, a grass-cutter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">{205}</span>
who performs his work properly has often to
walk many miles before reaching a spot where
soft tender grass is procurable. The grass-cutter
is under the immediate orders of the <i>syce</i>, and
usually receives four rupees a month as pay for
his services.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it may be mentioned, that
one of the most important rules in the young
Englishman’s household should be that each
native servant regularly receives his pay on a
certain date in each month. Without this
being steadily acted up to, matters never work
smoothly in an establishment, but will cause constant
bickerings. Whereas, when paid regularly,
and treated with kindness and forbearance, these
poor people speedily become attached to their
master, and exert themselves to meet with his
approval.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">According</span> to <i>Nature</i>, the much-dreaded scourge
of the vine, the Phylloxera, has made its appearance
in the vineyards of the Cape Colony. Some
years ago, the most stringent regulations were
made to prevent, if possible, the importation of
these unwelcome guests. The Cape government
even refused to allow consignments of beech-trees
from England and tree-ferns from New
Zealand to be landed in the colony, and fixed
a very heavy penalty as a punishment for any
infringement of the law. But by some mysterious
agency, two or three of the vineyards are
swarming with the Phylloxera. The most approved
insecticides, carbon disulphide, &amp;c., have
been telegraphed for, for they are not at hand
in the colony, and in the meantime the affected
vines are being uprooted and burnt.</p>

<p>A curious instance of tenacity of vitality in
low forms of life has been discovered by Professor
Leidy. Upon examining a block of ice which
formed part of a large quantity stored at Moorestown,
N.J., and had been so stored for more
than twelve months, he found it riddled with
air-bubbles and drops of water. Upon melting
a portion of the block, a number of worms
made their appearance. They died almost immediately
when liberated from their frozen prison.
The worms cannot be identified with any known
species, and Professor Leidy believes them to be
of a form as yet undescribed.</p>

<p>It is satisfactory to note that the Emperor of
Brazil has given orders for a photographic astronomical
apparatus like that employed so successfully
by MM. Henry of Paris, in order that
Brazil may do its share in the proposed photographic
survey of the heavens initiated by the
French astronomers named.</p>

<p>Lloyd’s agent at Athens has recently reported
some information as to the progress of the canal
which is to cut the Isthmus of Corinth. Out of
a total of thirteen million cubic yards of earth
which must be dug out before the canal is
completed, nearly three millions have been
removed. The canal is to have a surface width
of twenty-four yards, except at the entrances,
which will be widened to between fifty and sixty
yards. One thousand men are at present employed
upon the works, which, at the present
rate of progress, should be completed in five
years.</p>

<p>The Austrian government offer a prize of one
thousand ducats (nearly five hundred pounds)
for the discovery of a system of working coal in
fiery mines without shot-firing. The method
must not be more expensive than that of ordinary
blasting. It must not be capable of igniting
fire-damp or coal-dust, and it must not leave any
injurious products behind it. These are the chief
conditions.</p>

<p>An improved method of etching metallic surfaces
has been invented by Mr A. Piper of Wolverhampton.
The metal surface is first of all coated
with gold, silver, nickle, brass, or any other metal
desired, in the ordinary electro-plating bath.
The design is then drawn upon it in some resinous
or other acid-resisting medium, and the metal
is immersed in an acid, which eats away the coating,
and at the same time produces a dead or
frosted appearance upon the exposed metal beneath.
The resinous drawing is now removed by any
suitable medium which will dissolve it, leaving
the design in relief upon a frosted ground. If
desired, the operation can be reversed by leaving
a groundwork of plated metal, while the design
is bitten out by the acid.</p>

<p>A new stationary buffer-stop for railway stations
and sidings was recently described in a paper
read before the Institution of Mechanical Engineers
by Mr A. Langley of Derby. This buffer-stop
consists of two hydraulic cylinders fitted with
pistons. The piston rods carry in front buffer-heads
to meet those on the locomotive. There
are also projecting rods behind the cylinders connected
by chains with counterweights, to return
the pistons after pressure to their former position.
The pistons have a stroke of four feet; and it is
calculated that this amount of depression would
effectually stop a train without jerk or damage
even if it were moving at the rate of eight miles
an hour.</p>

<p>Gases inclosed in iron cylinders under enormous
pressure are now used in various branches
of science and art, and are supplied commercially
by many firms in various countries. The gases
most commonly used are hydrogen and oxygen—for
the lime-light—carbon dioxide, and nitrous
oxide—this last being much employed as an anæsthetic
by dentists. Hitherto, there has been much
difficulty in controlling the outrush of gas from
these cylinders, for the internal pressure often
amounts to six hundred pounds on the square
inch. By the aid of a new regulator, invented
by Messrs Oakley and Beard of London, this difficulty
is at once obviated. The regulator consists
of a small india-rubber bellows inclosed in a brass
box, which screws upon the nozzle of the gas
cylinder. By an ingenious device, as the bellows
top rises with the pressure of the gas, a screw
valve descends upon the opening in the cylinder.
In this way the user of the gas can regulate the
outflow to his requirements. We understand that
it is in contemplation to adapt the same principle
to ordinary gas consumption in houses, so that
the supply may always be adjusted to the number
of burners in actual use.</p>

<p>Habitual drinkers of aërated beverages were
some time ago startled by the report that the
original source of the water used in the manufacture
did not much trouble the attention of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">{206}</span>
the vendors, and that micro organisms in fabulous
numbers might find their way to the consumers
of these apparently innocent fluids. According
to Dr T. Leone’s researches, aërated waters are
peculiarly safe from such contamination. Taking
a typically pure potable water, he tried how
many micro organisms could be developed in it
in a given time. In five days the water contained
immense numbers of organisms. But
when charged with carbonic dioxide, as all
aërated waters must be to give them their
effervescent quality, the number of living creatures
was at once diminished. Water so charged
contained at the end of fifteen days only a
mere trifle of the original organisms. Dr Leone
therefore concludes that the longer aërated waters
are kept, the less chance is there of bacterial
contamination.</p>

<p>The greatest living authority on bacteria, M.
Pasteur, has by recent experiments proved that
water containing only two per cent. of concentrated
sulphuric acid possesses the property
of destroying these organisms. He recommends
that this acidulated water should be used as a
disinfectant for floors of stables, mangers, courtyards,
cattle-sheds, &amp;c. The compound has certainly
the merit of extreme cheapness, for about
twelve gallons could be prepared at a cost of
twopence. We may mention that M. Pasteur’s
inoculations for hydrophobia have met with
unlooked-for success. He recently told the Paris
Academy of Sciences that out of three hundred
and twenty-five cases of inoculation for this
terrible disease, only one had proved a failure,
and that one he attributed to delay. It is
suggested that an international hospital should
be established for the reception of patients from
every country.</p>

<p>The all-seeing microscope has very often played
an important part as an accusing witness, more
especially in the identification of blood-stains.
Recently in Illinois the same detective agent was
instrumental in hanging a murderer; but the
method of conviction was novel. Here is the
case: A. had been found murdered while sleeping
on a pile of sawdust in a certain icehouse, which
we will call No. 1. B. was suspected of the
crime because particles of sawdust were found
on his clothing and on his boots. He accounted
for this by pleading that he had been sleeping in
another icehouse (No. 2) which was far away; and
declared that he had not been near the No. 1
house. It was proved that icehouse No. 1 contained
<i>pine</i> sawdust, and house No. 2 hardwood
sawdust only. The microscope showed that the
clothes and boots had attached to them particles
of the former only. The man was convicted and
executed.</p>

<p>Professor Vogel has lately brought forward
the curious fact that the generation of alkaloids
in plants is dependent upon sunlight. The
hemlock plant which yields coniine in Southern
Europe contains none in Scotland. Again, the
tropical cinchonas, from which quinine is obtained,
will yield very little of that valuable product if
cultivated in our weakly lighted hothouses. Professor
Vogel has examined many specimens of
the plant from various conservatories, and has
been quite unable to obtain the characteristic
reaction of quinine, although the method of testing
is a delicate one, and sensitive to minute
quantities of the alkaloid. It is curious to
observe that although sunlight seems so necessary
to the formation of quinine in the living
plant, it acts most injuriously upon the alkaloid
in the stripped bark. In the latter case, the
quinine is decomposed by it, and assumes the
form of a dark-coloured resin. Because of this,
in the manufacture of quinine, the bark is
always dried in the dark.</p>

<p>The recent severe weather must have led many
a half-frozen traveller to wonder if our railway
and tramway Companies will ever hit upon some
method of heating public conveyances. With a
steam-engine as a necessary adjunct, it would
seem to the disinterested inquirer that a method
of warming by pipes fed from the ‘exhaust’ would
be a comparatively easy way of managing the
business, and would at the same time save much
labour in doing away with the filling and distribution
of inefficient foot-warmers. In Chicago, a
new method of heating tramcars is being tried,
and it promises well. The apparatus, which is
placed under the floor of the car, consists of a
brass cylinder filled with coal-oil, which, under
pressure of a strong spring, is forced into a small
super-heater, where it becomes vaporised. This
oil-gas is ignited in a fire-clay combustion chamber,
and although there is no flame, the fire-clay
is brought to a white heat. The outer air passing
over this hot box becomes well warmed, and a
constant stream of fresh, warm air is assured to
the passengers. The only visible evidence of the
stove is a grating in the floor of the car through
which the hot air rises. When will our tramway
Companies consent to a small reduction in their
high dividends, to afford their patrons similar
comfort?</p>

<p>The use of wood pavements in Sydney has
been very strongly condemned by a Committee
appointed by the Legislative Assembly of New
South Wales to inquire into the subject. It had
been alleged that these wood pavements exerted a
deleterious influence on the health of persons
living in their proximity, and the conclusions
arrived at by the Committee would seem to justify
these allegations. Analysis showed that the
blocks in actual use had absorbed a vast amount
of organic matter, even though they had only
been laid down a comparatively short time. It
was evident, too, that complete impregnation of
the wood was only a matter of time. In the
words of the Report: ‘So far as the careful
researches of your Board go, the porous, absorbent,
and destructible nature of wood must, in their
opinion, be declared to be irremediable by any
process at present known; nor, were any such
process discovered, would it be effectual unless it
were supplemented by another which should prevent
fraying of the fibre.’ It should be noted
that this strong condemnation is applied to the
<i>hard</i> wood-blocks used for the purpose of paving
in Sydney, and not to the soft wood used here at
home. These latter are so thoroughly impregnated
with tar, that it is difficult to imagine that
room could be found for anything else, organic or
otherwise.</p>

<p>The cable tramway which is situated on the
historic hill at Highgate, London, has worked
without hindrance during the recent frost and
snow. This is due to the fact that the working
parts are underground. But of late a new use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">{207}</span>
has been made of the system. Heavy vehicles
even with six horses attached could not be
moved up the hill during the recent frosts.
Many of them were therefore fastened to the
tramcars, and were pulled up the steep incline—one
in eleven—at the rate of six miles an hour.</p>

<p>In his recent lecture at the Royal Institution,
Mr A. A. Common, the treasurer of the Astronomical
Society, pointed out that the old method
of eye-observation in telescopic work would probably
in the near future give way to automatic
records on sensitive dry plates by means of
photography. He also pointed out what extreme
variations existed in the amount of light emitted
by different celestial objects, contrasting with the
blinding glare of the sun the small quantity of
light received from a faint star. The latter he
described as being equivalent to the twenty-thousandth
part of the light given by a standard
candle seen from the distance of a quarter of a
mile. It is not a matter for wonder, therefore,
that the most sensitive dry plate which would
yield a photograph in daylight in the smallest
fraction of a second, should require an exposure
of two hours, or thereabouts, when used for
recording the existence of one of these distant orbs.</p>

<p>Signor Ferrari, after making observations on
between six and seven hundred thunderstorms
which occurred in Italy a few years back, has
noted that every thunderstorm is connected with
a barometric, hygrometric, and thermic depression.
A German scientist who has interested himself
in the same line of inquiry, states that the danger
of a building being struck by lightning has
increased in his country during the past half-century
from three to five fold. He attributes
this increase of danger to impurities carried into
the atmosphere from factory chimneys, the
number of which is constantly increasing.</p>

<p>A new electric alarm-bell for use in places
where highways and railways cross one another
has been invented in the United States. On
approaching such a crossing, the wheels of the
train depress a heavy trigger placed by the side
of the rails. This trigger sets in motion a flywheel
sufficiently powerful to turn the armature
of a small magneto-machine. The current thus
generated rings a bell at the cross-road, so that
wayfarers have an audible reminder of the near
approach of a train. Of course the same result
might be brought about with an electric battery.
But the magneto-machine has the advantage of
requiring no attention, and of not being affected
in any way by changes of temperature. Its
bearings can be provided with oil-cups, so that
it will act for months together without supervision.</p>

<p>Professor Ewart lately read a paper before the
Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh, in which
he stated that from examinations of specimens
of ‘whitebait’ sent into the London market
during the past year, he had come to the conclusion
that the much esteemed little fish consisted
of sprats and herrings, about sixty per cent. of
the former to forty per cent. of the latter. The
origin of so-called ‘whitebait’ has always been
such a disputed point that the Professor’s remarks
are particularly interesting. He also pointed
out that in Canada, sprats are extensively tinned
as sardines. As we some time ago pointed out
in these pages, a similar trade has been for a
long time carried on at more than one place on
the south coast of England. We may mention
that the authorities of the South Kensington
Aquarium are about to introduce herrings into
the tanks under their control, in spite of the
fact that all such attempts, in inland places at
least, have hitherto failed. We trust that their
endeavours will be crowned with success.</p>

<p>Messrs Fairbairn and Wells, Manchester, have
lately much improved their screw forging
machine. By this method of making screws,
it is claimed that much greater tenacity, ductility,
and durability are obtained in the finished
product; for the fibres of iron, instead of being
cut through, are pressed and bent round to the
shape of the thread. In short, the machine
rolls out the screws, instead of cutting them
out. We have lately seen photographs of some
of these screws which have been partially eaten
away with acid, for the purpose of showing
the fibrous nature of the metal. It is curious
to note how the fibre is bent in and out as
it follows the direction of the thread on the
screw. This method of manufacture is said to
present advantages apart from better quality.
The screws can be more quickly produced at a
less cost, and there is a great saving of material,
for nothing is cut away to waste.</p>

<p>The results of a curious but very important
test as to the accuracy with which chemists,
druggists, and others make up prescriptions
committed to their care, has recently been
presented to one of the London vestries. Fifty
prescriptions were sent out to ordinary druggists,
to co-operative stores, to ‘doctors’ shops,’ and
to certain traders styling themselves drug
Companies. The mixtures made were afterwards
analysed, to find out how nearly they
agreed with the prescriptions they represented;
but in order to give a liberal margin for error,
it was resolved not to put a black mark against
any one, if the chief constituent were within
ten per cent. of the right amount. Notwithstanding
this margin, no fewer than seventeen
out of the fifty mixtures were incorrectly dispensed.
In one case the principal drug was
less by eighty-five per cent. than the amount
ordered, while in another it was fifty-seven per
cent. in excess. The chemists and druggists
came out best in this strange competition, as
only six per cent. of their prescriptions had
to be called in question. Next came the co-operative
stores with twenty per cent. of error;
then the ‘doctors’ shops’ with fifty per cent.;
and lastly the drug Companies, who are credited,
or rather discredited, with seventy-five per cent.
of errors.</p>

<h3>THE ROOSEN METHOD OF PRESERVING FISH.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have already noticed the method recommended
by Professor Cossar Ewart of preserving
fresh fish with boracic acid and salt. Mr Roosen
of Hamburg has patented another method, which
was lately tested in Edinburgh. The process
consists in the salmon being placed in an air-tight
compartment among a solution of boracic
acid, salt, and water, and a heavy pressure being
applied, the solution penetrates and thoroughly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">{208}</span>
disinfects the fish, which are prevented from
decaying, and retain all their strength and
nourishment. On the 15th of February, a steel
barrel, made for the purpose, and capable of
holding about three hundred pounds of fish,
was filled with salt water containing about fifty
per cent. of boracic acid, and into this compound
five splendid salmon, fresh from the
Tay, were placed. The air having been entirely
withdrawn, the barrel was hermetically sealed,
a pressure of six atmospheres, or ninety pounds
to the square inch, being applied. After standing
for seventeen days, the barrel was opened
on the 4th of March, and all the salmon were
found in as fresh and healthy a condition as
when they were first placed among the solution.
The flesh of the fish was of a beautiful
colour, and could not be distinguished from
that of a fresh salmon placed alongside of it,
while the blood began to flow freely immediately
on the salmon being cut up. The salmon was
served up at a luncheon, on the following day,
in different forms of cooking, and the general
opinion was that the new method of preservation
was upon the whole successful. The fish was of
good flavour and colour; it could be separated in
nice flakes, and the curd was well preserved.</p>


<h3>A NEW BOILER-FEEDER.</h3>

<p>The problem of feeding boilers has yet to be
solved, no method yet introduced having by its
intrinsic merits superseded all others. At the
present time, injectors or donkey-engines are
usually employed—the former being an ingenious
apparatus which forces the feed-water into the
boiler by the rush of steam through a narrow
orifice; the latter differing in no way from an
ordinary pumping-engine, and usually deriving
its power from the boiler itself. Both these
systems of feeding require constant supervision;
and it is to obviate the necessity of continued
attention and the risk resulting from carelessness,
that boiler-feeders automatic in action have been
designed. So far, their application has not been
extensive; but a recent improved design, patented
as ‘Mayhew’s Automatic Boiler-feeder,’ bids fair
to push its way even in these times of depressed
trade, when boiler-owners not unnaturally hesitate
to incur any outlay, however slight, which
a rearrangement of the boiler-feed necessarily
entails. The apparatus consists essentially of two
vessels—the upper of copper, the lower of cast-iron.
An ingenious valve-arrangement connects
the former with the boiler, whilst the latter is
connected with the supply of feed-water. When
the water in the boiler falls below a certain
level, the end of the pipe connected with the
upper vessel becomes uncovered, and the steam
being free to enter it, operates on the valves,
thereby admitting a charge of water to the boiler
from the copper vessel. A vacuum is formed in
the copper vessel, which now recharges itself
from the one beneath, ready for another operation.
As many as five charges a minute can
thus be obtained. Should the apparatus, from
any cause, fail to work, and the water fall too
low, a fusible plug melts and sounds an alarm
whistle. It is satisfactory to note that an ingenious
straining arrangement works well for feeding
with dirty water—the great difficulty in all
apparatus of this class, owing to the valves
becoming choked. The feeder may be regarded
as safely beyond the mere experimental stage,
a large number already being in operation in
different works throughout the country, and with
results satisfactory in every respect.</p>


<h3>SHOT-FIRING IN COAL-MINES.</h3>

<p>A correspondent thus writes: ‘In your article
on “Shot-firing in Coal-mines” you speak of the
dangerous operation of tamping or plugging the
shot-hole with brick or coal dust rammed hard.
It must indeed be a dangerous operation; but
cannot the hole be as effectually plugged without
any danger at all? It is usual, after charging
a rocket, to drive in dry clay upon the
top of the fuse, to prevent its blowing through;
but a layer of wet plaster of Paris poured in
and allowed to set, dries harder than the clay,
and obviates all danger from concussion or grit.
Cannot the shot-hole be in like manner plugged?
Plaster of Paris (gypsum or sulphate of lime)
expands, not shrinks, when combined with water,
so that it fills accurately every part of the bore.
If the hole were slightly conical, the smaller
end outwards, or made with an internal flange,
the plaster would offer more resistance than the
clay.’</p>
